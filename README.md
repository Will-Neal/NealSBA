# NealSBA

  ## Description

   NealSBA is the submission title for my JavaScript skill based assessment. The project is a 3-page web page called The Lineup. The lineup is a personal surf journal that allows users to track their sessions as well as to compare the expected conditions against the actual conditions.

## Usage

  Since this is a prototype, login is possible but not required. If you continue as guest you will have access to all of the features but will not be greeted by your personal username. The journal and photos pages will start empty. Journal entries and images are added by completing the form and cleared by pressing the red button. Images are added by providing the correct URL.
